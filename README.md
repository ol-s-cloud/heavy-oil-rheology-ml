### Heavy Oil Rheological Properties Analysis using Ensemble Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning analysis of heavy crude oil rheological properties using an ensemble approach combining Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The analysis focuses on predicting and understanding various viscosity parameters and their relationships with temperature and shear conditions.

## Features
- Ensemble model combining:
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis for model interpretation
- Cross-validation for model performance evaluation
- Feature importance analysis

## Data Parameters
The analysis includes the following key parameters:
1. Independent Variables:
   - Density
   - Temperature
   - Shear Stress
   - Shear Rate

2. Target Variables:
   - Apparent Viscosity
   - Plastic Viscosity
   - Yield Point

## Model Components
1. Data Preparation:
   - Feature scaling using StandardScaler
   - Train-test splitting
   - Data combination from multiple experimental sources

2. Model Pipeline:

   - Feature importance ranking

3. Analysis Tools:
   - SHAP value calculations
   - Performance metrics (RMSE, RÂ², MAE)
   - Feature interaction analysis

## Requirements
```python
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
shap
