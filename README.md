### Abstract
This study investigates the enhanced recovery of Agbabu bitumen in Ondo State, southwestern Nigeria, via a thermal injection approach using a machine learning architecture. The research employs a 3-stage SKlearn pipeline with Gradient Boosting and SHAP analysis to examine the flow properties of bitumen under thermal conditions.

### Key Findings
- Thermal treatment at 977Â°F significantly reduced bitumen viscosity
- Machine learning model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, especially for yield point predictions
- Identified critical temperature ranges and non-linear viscosity behavior
