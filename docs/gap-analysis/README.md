# Gap Analysis Documents

This directory contains historical gap analysis documents for the Heavy Oil Rheology ML project (RheoML). Each document represents a point-in-time analysis of the project's current state, identified gaps, and recommendations for improvement.

## Purpose

Gap analysis documents help the project team:

1. Identify areas where the current implementation falls short of requirements or best practices
2. Prioritize development efforts to address the most critical gaps
3. Track progress over time as gaps are addressed
4. Maintain historical context of project evolution

## Document Format

Each gap analysis follows a consistent format:

- Historical Development Status
- Structured Gap Analysis by Category
- Priority Recommendations
- Conclusions
