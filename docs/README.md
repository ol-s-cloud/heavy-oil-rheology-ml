## About the Project

The Heavy Oil Rheology ML project began as an academic initiative focused on applying machine learning techniques to analyze the flow properties of heavy crude oil under thermal conditions. It is evolving into RheoML, a comprehensive SaaS platform that will enable multi-device data analysis, advanced ML modeling, and interactive visualizations for rheological research and industrial applications.

## Development Path

The project is following a phased development approach:

1. **Current (v0.1.0)**: Research-focused machine learning pipeline for heavy oil rheology
2. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Web-based application with data upload and visualization interface
3. **Phase 2**: Multi-device compatibility and enhanced ML capabilities
4. **Phase 3**: Full SaaS platform with tiered pricing and enterprise features
5. **Phase 4**: Advanced features including federated learning and IoT integration

See the [product roadmap](./roadmap/2025-04-18-product-roadmap.md) for detailed information about each phase.

## Key Features

- **Three-Stage ML Pipeline**: Preprocessing, machine learning with gradient boosting, and analysis with SHAP
- **Multi-Device Compatibility**: Support for various rheometer manufacturers (planned)
- **Advanced Analytics**: Customizable ML models with uncertainty quantification (planned)
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time, comparative data analysis (planned)
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving model improvements (planned)
