**Status: COMPLETED**

Major milestone achieved with the publication of research findings:

- Paper "Three-Stage Machine Learning Pipeline Ensemble with Gradient Boosting and SHAP Analysis" published in GJET
- Initial model performance documented:
  * Yield Point Prediction: R² = 0.9627, RMSE = 30.5390 Pa
  * Apparent Viscosity Prediction: R² = 0.8428, RMSE = 2.1546 Pa·s
- Academic validation of approach received through peer review
- Research findings presented to petroleum engineering community

## Q1 2025: Version 0.1.0 Release

## Resource Allocation Status

**Status: UNDER REVIEW**

Current resource allocation is primarily research-focused with limited production engineering support:

- Research personnel: Adequate
- Software engineering support: Insufficient
- DevOps capabilities: Not allocated
- User experience design: Not allocated
- Documentation resources: Minimal

The project requires additional technical resources to address the significant gaps identified in moving from research prototype to production-ready tool.

## Conclusion

The Heavy Oil Rheology ML project has successfully established its scientific validity and potential value through research publication and initial software implementation. While the core machine learning approach shows promising results, the project is still in an early stage with significant development needed to address gaps in data diversity, technical implementation, usability, scientific methodology, and deployment capabilities.

The highest priority for the next development phase should be expanding the experimental dataset and implementing more robust model optimization techniques to strengthen the foundational aspects of the project before addressing deployment and interface enhancements.
