# Project Status Documents

This directory contains historical status reports for the Heavy Oil Rheology ML project (RheoML). Each document captures the state of the project at a specific point in time, recording completed milestones, ongoing work, and planned activities.

## Purpose

Project status documents serve several key functions:

1. Provide a historical record of project development
2. Track progress against goals and timelines
3. Communicate project state to stakeholders
4. Document decision points and their context
5. Maintain continuity during team changes or transitions

## Document Format

Each status report follows a historical timeline format:

- Development history by phase/period
- Current status with completed and in-progress items
- Upcoming priorities
- Resource allocation status
- Conclusions and recommendations
