# Sprint Planning Documents

This directory contains sprint planning documents for the Heavy Oil Rheology ML project (RheoML). These documents outline the tactical implementation approach for transforming the research project into a comprehensive platform through well-defined development sprints.

## Purpose

Sprint planning documents serve to:

1. Break down the project vision into manageable, time-bound deliverables
2. Define specific tasks and objectives for short development cycles
3. Provide clear expectations for development teams
4. Create measurable milestones to track progress
5. Maintain focus on high-priority features and improvements

## Document Format

Each sprint planning document includes:

- Development methodology overview
- Phase-based organization of sprints
- Sprint-level breakdown with goals, tasks, and deliverables
- Timeline estimates for implementation
- Priority recommendations based on project needs
- Dependencies between sprints and components
